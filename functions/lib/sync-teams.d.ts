/**
 * sync-teams.ts
 *
 * Cloud Function: syncs full team info for every team that plays in any of
 * the 51 configured leagues. Writes one `teams/{teamId}` doc per team with
 * enough detail to power TeamDetailScreen without any client-side
 * SportMonks calls.
 *
 * Architecture rationale: previously `useTeamDetail` hit the SportMonks
 * proxy three times per team-page open (fetchTeamById + fetchSquad +
 * fetchTeamRecentFixtures). With ~15k users that scales linearly into the
 * API quota. This function pulls the data once per day per league and
 * serves every user from Firestore.
 *
 * Schedule: every 24h. Team info (stadium, coach, founded year) changes on
 * a weekly-to-yearly timescale, so daily is generous.
 *
 * Cost: 51 leagues × 1 call/league (single page typically holds all teams
 * including pagination) ≈ 60-100 SM calls/day. ~0.1% of the Pro plan.
